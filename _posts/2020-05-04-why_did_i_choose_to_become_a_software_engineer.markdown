Growing up in Hawaii for the first 25 years of my life I had many dreams and ambitions. There were many forks in the road and choices I made that influenced me to move to Las Vegas in the year 2017. About a year in after moving I didn't really know anyone up here but I was working as an in home furniture assembler for IKEA. It's funny because I remember going to big houses and wondering what do I have to do to become successful in this lifetime. My bestfriend Bryson and I always had goals on creating content and a lot of it was dealing with technology so online content became our goal. We had no idea on where to start or what path to go but we wanted to attract these skills into our lives. It's funny because I soon met a client who just so happen to be a full-stack developer and after getting to know eachother while I was building his furniture he took me under his wing and showed me a path to follow. He was self-taught but we eventually stopped staying in touch as much but I continued to follow this path he started me off on. I told myself to forget everything I thought I knew when I first started this. I started off learning on SoloLearn it definetly crafted my mind with HTML and CSS. I than dipped into learning a language so I studied a little bit of javascript and python. But things started getting more complex and I felt back to square one and realized that what I wanted was a group I could build with. So me taking the big leap and decided to choose Flatiron as my school of choice. So here I am now working my way into becoming a Software Engineer with other peers who is on the same journey as me.
