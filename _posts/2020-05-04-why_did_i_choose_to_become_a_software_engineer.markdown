    Born and raised in Hawaii and now living in sin city at the age of 27 years old. I grew up with many dreams and ambitions butI would have never of thought I would be pursuing on becoming a software engineer. About a year in after moving I didn't really know anyone up here but I was working as an in home furniture assembler for IKEA. It's funny because I remember going to mansion's and wondering what do I have to do to become successful in this lifetime. 
		
		My bestfriend Bryson and I always had goals on creating content and a lot of it was dealing with technology so online content became our goal. We had no idea on where to start or what path to go but we wanted to attract these skills into our lives. Well the world hears what you want to attract and  I soon met a client who just so happened to be a full-stack developer and after getting to know eachother while I was building his furniture. He was a self-taught developer who showed me a path to take and if it could spark my interest. Although we eventually stopped staying in touch, I continued to follow this path he started me on. I told myself to forget everything I thought I knew when I first started this. I started learning on SoloLearn as it definetly crafted my mind with HTML and CSS. I than dipped into the next big step which was learning a language so I studied a little bit of javascript and python. 
		
	 As things started getting more complex, I started to feel back to square one and realized that what I wanted was a group I could build with. I needed to join a platform that I can learn and communicate with and what better than an online school. So I took the big leap and decided to choose Flatiron as my school of choice. Here I am now working my way into becoming a Software Engineer with other peers who are on the same journey as me.
